# Feature Engineering with SMOTE

This project demonstrates how to perform feature engineering and address class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). The process involves loading a dataset, visualizing class distribution, applying SMOTE to balance the dataset, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## 📁 Contents

* Data preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Handling class imbalance with SMOTE
* Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## 📊 Techniques Used

* **Feature Engineering**: Preparing and transforming features for modeling.
* **SMOTE**: A technique to generate synthetic samples for the minority class in imbalanced datasets.
* **Visualization**: Using Seaborn and Matplotlib to explore and understand data distribution.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `seaborn`
* `matplotlib`
* `scikit-learn`
* `imbalanced-learn`

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this notebook:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Feature_Engineering_SMOTE.ipynb
   ```

## 📈 Example Visualizations

The notebook includes various plots such as:

* Class distribution before and after SMOTE
* Feature histograms
* Pair plots and correlation heatmaps

## ✅ Results

After applying SMOTE, the class distribution becomes balanced, which can improve the performance of machine learning models on imbalanced datasets.
